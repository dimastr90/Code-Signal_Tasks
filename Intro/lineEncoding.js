/*
Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:

First, the string is divided into the least possible number of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
for example, "aabbbc" is divided into ["aa", "bbb", "c"]
Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character
for example, substring "bbb" is replaced by "3b"
Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the same order and a new string is returned.
Example

For s = "aabbbc", the output should be
lineEncoding(s) = "2a3bc".

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[input] string s

String consisting of lowercase English letters.

Guaranteed constraints:
4 â‰¤ s.length â‰¤ 15.

[output] string

Encoded version of s.
